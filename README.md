👋 Hey there, I'm Ralph Santos

🚀 Fullstack / Backend Developer | ☕ Fueled by caffeine and late-night debugging

💡 About Me

I’m a developer who speaks fluent PHP and dreams in Laravel syntax.
When I’m not wrestling with APIs or refactoring code that “worked on my machine,” you’ll probably find me celebrating a deploy that finally didn’t break production.

I build stuff like:

💳 Payment Gateway using Xendit – where the real magic (and money) happens.

⚙️ Tech Stack

PHP | Laravel | REST APIs | MySQL | Git | CoffeeScript (not really)

🧠 Fun Developer Facts

My code runs on hope and printf debugging.

I believe in semicolons, dark mode, and CTRL + Z.

99% of my commits are “fix: something that shouldn’t have broken.”

“Code, coffee, and chaos — the perfect trio.” ☕💻🔥
